Within Catena-X, acceptable values for the declared unit include “piece” and “kilogram,” as outlined in the Catena-X PCF Rulebook v4, chapter 4.4. The PCF is calculated per declared unit amount of the product. For example, a Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) may be represented in two ways. In the first case, the declared unit amount is 1 and the declared unit is “piece,” resulting in a total PCF including bio uptake of 15,000 kg CO?e. In the second case, the same BEV is described with a declared unit amount of 2,300 and the unit is “kilogram,” while still yielding a total PCF including bio uptake of 15,000 kg CO?e. ;
